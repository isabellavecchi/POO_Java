/*
*   INHERITANCE
*
*   A CLASS that inherits is called a SUBCLASS
*
*   a CLASS that is inherited from is called a SUPERCLASS
*
*   subclass = superclass;
*
*   a CLASS can have MANY SUBclasses, but ONLY ONE SUPERclass
*
*   anything whith a PRIVATE modifier is NOT inherited, but can
* be indirectly accessed.
*/

/*
*   IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT OVERRIDING
*
*   Overriding replaces a method in a superclass with a different
* version in the subclass.
*
*   Only NON-STATIC methods can be OVERRIDEN.
*
*   There is something similar called HIDING, that can be done with
* STATIC methods.
*
*   PRIVATE methods CAN'T be overriden.
*/

/*
*   CALLING METHODS IN A SUPERCLASS     (Super key)
*
*   We can use super key to call  methods in a superclass that have
* been overriden.
*
*   super() can also be used in a constructor to call a constructor
* in a superclass.
*/

/*
*   ACCESSING PRIVATE FIELDS IN A SUPERCLASS
*
*   We cannot DIRECTLY access private fields in a superclass.
*
*   We can INDIRECTLY access them, if there are GETTER and SETTER
* methods in the superclass.
